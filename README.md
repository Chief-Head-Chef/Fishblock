# Fishblock

starts out as skyblock.  You are equipped with only a fishing rod, and a small pool

Fishing rods will be made out of different resources.  Rods will retrieve at random anything that rod is capable of retrieving, limited by the type of pool/pond also.
EG: Basic rod can catch wood, stone and dirt fish, unless the pond is a dirt pond, therefore limiting catches to dirtfish.

Tiers so far:
Wood rod (default, provided at start)
Stone rod
Iron rod
Gold rod
Diamond rod
Netherite rod
Enderium rod


Fish available from pool will be tied to capabilities of the rod.  Wood rod eg:
Woodfish
Stonefish
Dirtfish
Stringfish



Fisbowls are chests (early game, no automation)
Fish ponds / pools (size dependant) are automated large storage bins
